# API Keys

API keys are an essential component for managing access and ensuring security within your system. Each user is required to have a unique API key to interact with the platform. Operators have the ability to create multiple API keys for a single channel, allowing for flexible access management for users of that specific channel.

## Key Generation Process

When an API key is created, a 64-character code is automatically generated. This key is designed with security in mind and can only be viewed once during its creation. This ensures that the key remains confidential and protected against unauthorized access.

## Steps to Create an API Key

1. **Navigate to the API Keys Section**:

   - Go to the API Channels tab in the dashboard.
   - Click on the **API Keys** button.

     </div>

2. **Access the API Keys Dialog Box**:

   - A dialog box will appear, displaying a table of all previously generated API keys.
   - If no keys have been created yet, the table will appear empty.

3. **Generate a New API Key**:

   - Click the **Generate API Key** button within the dialog box.
   - Enter a descriptive name for the API key in the input field.

    </div>

   - Click **Generate** to create the new key.
   - The newly generated 64-character key will be displayed. **Copy this key immediately**, as it will only be visible once.

## Important Note

It is strongly recommended to store the API key securely. If an API key is misplaced or lost, it cannot be retrieved. In such cases, the operator will need to generate a new key. Always ensure proper handling and secure storage of API keys to avoid disruptions.

## Managing API Keys

- All API keys created by an operator will be listed in the table within the API Keys dialog box.
- Operators have the option to delete any API key as needed. This provides control over which keys remain active and helps maintain system security.
